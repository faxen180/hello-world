this is for school, danny elfman is a hack

Danny Elfman went back on his classic film "The Forbidden Zone" for obvious political reasons, however for him to say that his old work is embarassing is an embarrassment itself. Danny Elfman gets way more work than he should and I have not seen DJ Jazzy Jeff is the better part of 14 years.
